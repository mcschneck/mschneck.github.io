        <p>
            I am a senior at Northwestern pursuing a degree in computer science through Weinberg College of Arts & Sciences (WCAS). 
            I'm interested in computing ethics, algorithms, systems design, and sustainable/efficient computing and 
            have additional experience in web development, machine and deep learning, and computational photography.
            I've been fortunate to hold 3 software engineering internships in embedded systems, machine learning, and app development, 
            and will be starting a fulltime role as an embedded systems software engineer following graduation in June 2023. 
            Outside of school and work, I enjoy swimming, biking, and running as a member of the Northwestern Triathlon team and
            running the Wild Roots student garden on Northwestern's campus as a co-president for the 2022-2023 school year.
